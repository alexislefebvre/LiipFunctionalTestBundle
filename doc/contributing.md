# Contributing
This is for people who want to contribute to the project.

## How to get started

First of all, you need to fork the repository and clone it locally.

You need to be able to run `docker`. Otherwise, you can install `php-cs-fixer` on your own and run it with the
parameters shown in the `scripts` section in `composer.json`.  

Run PHP-CS-Fixer:

```bash
composer run-script php-cs-fixer
```
